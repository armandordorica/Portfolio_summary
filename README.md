# Portfolio_summary

###  ML Modelling (Applied Research at Flexiti Financial)
Currently working on developing Application-Level Fraud Models using Random Forests and Adaptive Gradient Boosting. 
Performing variable selection by using a number of techniques based on the business context and the nature of the data such as:
* Recursive Feature Selection (based on entropy and Gini Purity)
* Simple techniques such as feature correlation with target variable
* PCA (singular value decomposition and taking eigenvectors associated to highest eigenvalues)
* Logistic Regression on subsets of features

### Experiment Design 
* Using A/B tests to study cause-effect relationships and compare validity/usability of different strategies 

### Master's Thesis (Applied Research at Capital One)
